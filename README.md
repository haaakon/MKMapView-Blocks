MKMapView-Blocks
================
Adds blocks to all MKMapView delegate methods with a simple and easy to use category, no subclassing. Also allows the use of delegate methods if no block is set for a particular method.

    }
    MKPinAnnotationView *annotationView = (MKPinAnnotationView *)[mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:@"mapAnnotation"];

        annotationView = [[MKPinAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:@"mapAnnotation"];
    }
